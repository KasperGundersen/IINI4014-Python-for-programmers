##File I/O and text processing

**Introduction**

In this assignment we will learn about navigating the file system, file I/O, and efficient use of lists and dictionaries.

This assignment is broken up into two tasks.

1. Write a function getwordfreqs() that takes a filename as input and returns a dictionary of words and their frequencies.
2. Write a function getwordsline() that takes as input a file name and a word (string) and returns a list of the line numbers were the word is found.

The zip file contains folders with text files for experimenting.
