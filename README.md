*NTNU course, autumn 2020. 
Credits:  5.0 SP.
Study level: Third-year courses, level III*

## Course content
The course uses problem-based learning and directed self-study to teach intermediate-level Python to students who already have programming experience in one or more other languages. The course will start with an introduction to programming in Python where the students will learn about the use of the Python interpreter, numbers, strings and lists. From there we will rapidly introduce control flow tools and functions. The course will then introduce data structures, modules, input and output, errors and exceptions and classes.

## Learning outcome
### KNOWLEDGE (kunnskaper):
*The candidate:*
- knows about core Python structures and flow control
- is familiar with the Python library
- knows about object-oriented programming with Python
- understands handling of errors and exceptions
- understands Python Editors and IDEs


### SKILLS (ferdigheter):
*The candidate:*
- can create and run Python functions
- can practice with Python execution environment
- can handle the file-system with Python scripts
- master the concepts of sequences and file operations
- knows how to use and create functions, sorting different elements, Lambda function and error handling.


### GENERAL COMPETENCE (generell kompetanse):
*The candidate:*
- have competence in best practices when it comes to testing and debuging in Python
- master the basic and advanced concepts of Python
- can use Python to work on a real life project

## Learning methods and activities
The course is structured around directed self-study (readings from the textbook, Internet resources such as short videos and code snippets) and associated mandatory and voluntary assignments that provides the students with the motivation to gain a strong practical understanding of the material.
The course is problem-based, meaning the majority of the learning comes as a result from solving the assignments.
