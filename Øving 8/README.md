Define and implement a class to model a six-sided die that can be rolled and drawn on a canvas. This class can then be used by programs that call for rolling a die.

The brief:

The common die is a six-sided object and each side contains one to six dots. When the die is rolled, one of the six faces ends up on top. This is the value of the die after the roll.

 

You need to:

Create a die whose position (x-y coordinates of one on the corners) and size is provided by the user.

Access the position and size of the die.

Roll the die.

Access the value of the face shown on top of the die.

Set the colour used to draw the die and the colour of the dots (default colours are white and black).

Draw the die on a canvas.
