There are many ways to analyse text.

Some of those are:

1. Sentence length in words,
2. Percentage of easy words: easy words are those used frequently: they have high frequency in documents,
3. Percentage of difficult words: difficult words are those that are seldom used and have low frequency in documents,
4. Percentage of different words: A count of the unique words in the document divide by the total number of words,
5. Number of sentences per paragraph.

Your task is to write a Python code that analyses a text file and returns the measures listed in (1-5).

Use the first file (text file provided in previous assignment) to create a dictionary (histogram) of the words and their associated frequencies. You can then use the histogram to judge if a word in the second (also from previous assignment) file is easy, has high frequency, or difficult.

Note that you can use any text file or use the files attached here.

Please comment your code clearly to help me understand what you are doing and thinking.

Use clear variable names like WordLength.
